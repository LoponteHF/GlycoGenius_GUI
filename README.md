# GlycoGenius - Glycomics Data Analysis Tool

GlycoGenius is a python script that aims to be an all-in-one solution for data analysis of N- and O-glycomics full scan or DDA data.

Glycobiologists analyzing glycans' mass spectrometer data usually rely on several different tools to perform different tasks on different parts of their workflow and, in between the use of all those different tools, there's usually a lot of manual work that has to be done at least for data curating.

With that in mind, this tool aims to put all the usual workflow for glycomics in a single place.

In order to do that, this tool is able to do several different tasks:
- Create glycans libraries based on user input, which can be monosaccharides numbers or specific glycans;
- Automatically identify noise level in samples;
- Process the spectra data and creates refined extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) for each glycan analyzed;
- Peak-picks multiple peaks in a single EIC, which allows the identification and possibly quantification of plausible isomers;
- Provides scorings of isotopic distribution peaks and chromatogram peak curve fitting based on relation and correlation;
- Identify PPM differences between theoretical mass and identified mz;
- Calculates signal-to-noise ratio;
- Identifies MS2 glycans' fragments and assign them to its respective precursor;
- Many other features.

## Installation

Download the latest version from Releases page, unzip it and run the executable file.
	
## Usage

1. Export your MS data to an MzXML or MzML file;
2. Open GlycoGenius;
3. Follow the buttons workflow on the top part of the program.
